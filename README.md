# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise compare the success of her campaign to the success and failure of other campaigns in relation to their launch date and goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
One challenge I faced was when I was creating the graph for the Theater Outcomes vs Launch data set. My graph looked different from the example graph, even though I had everything set up as it should be. After some time, I figured out that I was organizing the data by whether it was successful or not, rather than organizing it by id numbers.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Kickstarters launched during May were most successful, with those being launched in December being the least successful, as can be seen by the graph labeled "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png". ![Outcomes_vs_Launch.png](https://github.com/Athenus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Kickstarters with very small goals such as those less than $1,000 and those between $1,000 and $4,999 were the most successful. Those between $35,000 and $44,999 were only slightly less successful. Goals greater than or equal to $45,000 were extremely unlikely to succeed, and no kickstarters with goals between $45,000 to $49,999 succeeded. Goals between $25,000 and $34,999 were also very unlikely to succeed. This data can be seen with the graph labeled "Outcomes_vs_Goals.png". ![Outcomes_vs_Goals.png](https://github.com/Athenus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

It would seem that most of the successful kickstarters are launched in May, while the least successful are launched in December.
The number of canceled kickstarters did not seem to change much no matter when the kickstarter was launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Kickstarters with goals greater than or equal to $45,000 were extremely unlikely to succeed. Goals that were less than $1,000 to $4,999 were fairly likely to succeed, as were those between $35,000 and $44,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

At best, the dataset shows correlations. If someone were to do the exact same thing as someone who succeeded with their kickstarter, there would be no guarantee that they would succeed

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A table/graph that takes into account the country or number of backers could be created. The number of backers might be less useful since that is fairly difficult to control, but adding the country as a variable would
